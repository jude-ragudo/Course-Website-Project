						<h3 style="color: white">Background of the 19th Century Philippines in Light of the Education System</h3>

						<h2 style="color: white"><br>The Education System Under the Colonial Government: Significant Strides and Drawbacks</h2>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The birth of a formal education system under Spanish colonization had a complex history. It was  inevitable that any significant development would be intertwined with political, economic, and social affairs of the time period. Majority of the schools that were first opened in the era were supervised by religious orders and missionaries, with records that reported that institutions were established as far back as the 16th century (Musa & Ziatdinov, 2012). One of the most famous colleges in the Philippines and in Asia — the University of Santo Tomas — was founded around this time (Durban & Catalan, 2012; University of Santo Tomas, 2023).</p>
			
						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Apart from the common issues that would have inevitably occurred within the school environments at the time, external factors also plagued the establishment of an education  system as a whole. The reality of implementing a systematic form of teaching in the Philippines’ vast landscape and cultures was a difficult task. In spite of Spanish authorities having a form of blueprint or guide in the form of the Recopilacion de las Leyes de Indias (Law of the Indies), the problems of communication, convenience, and access to all the different groups were emphasized (Musa & Ziatdinov, 2012; Pilapil, 1961). In the former article, however, great strides were made as the Spanish learned the native languages themselves to advance their empire, thus leading to the subsequent change of Philippine society permanently.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The challenges did not end in this regard, as both economic and political circumstances created inevitable realities for the education system. The core of its implementation revolved around the Philippines as a colonial territory, which meant there was an emphasis on subjecting and exposing knowledge and a form of learning for the sake of control rather than genuine prospects of spreading education or intellectual matters (Deped Resources, 2014; Durban & Catalan, 2012; Low, Maghanoy, Velasco, Christy, & Bihasa, 2021).</p>
											
						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">At the cost of this ambition, high funds were needed to maintain and assert dominance over the nation, as a lot of resources and manpower were insufficient to carry out the management of schools; and as a result, the responsibility primarily fell unto religious orders and missionaries (Pilapil, 1961). While the authority of friars over schools was not unheard of — especially with the intention to spread Christianity over the islands — it prompted the curriculum to focus on religion and other practical subjects revolving generally around arithmetics, reading, writing, language learning, as well as various arts and mathematics (Autida, 2023; Deped Resources, 2014; Durban & Catalan, 2012; Low, Maghanoy, Velasco, Christy, & Bihasa, 2021).</p>
			
						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Additionally, in spite of the existence of educational institutions throughout different areas in the nation, access was a prominent issue towards the natives. One of these socio-economic conditions was that only a few had a right to access education the Spanish had established, specifically the privileged and those of higher-economic status, thus Filipinos subsequently encountered discrimination based on social class, racial identity, and gender (Autida, 2023; Durban & Catalan, 2012; Musa & Ziatdinov, 2012). The friars and religious orders — as another prominent body of control over the institutions — also allowed opportunities for prejudice and inadequacy to occur at the expense of  marginalized communities at the time (Deped Resources, 2014; Musa & Ziatdinov, 2012; Pilapil, 1961). It was a controversial matter and caused negative reception amongst the natives — who desperately craved reformation.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">It was only in the 19th century that serious changes were implemented. While the reason for its implementation was dependent on many factors, Spain’s loss of the majority of its Latin American colonies pushed the question of the Philippines’ state as a money-making power (Pilapil, 2021). Reported in the same article, King Philip II offered a different perspective as he saw the nation as a valuable entity, thus a plethora of improvements through its government administrations and educational system alike were implemented. Numerous developments in the global stage at the time could have possibly prompted the idea of more reforms to be established in the Philippines (Durban & Catalan, 2012).</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The Educational Decree of 1863 stood out as the Spanish arranged a modern system of public education, which allowed important developments such as the tutelage of male and female educators, the establishment of schools separate for boys and girls, and the natives now possessing the capabilities to attend school (Autida, 2023; Deped Resources, 2014; Low, Maghanoy, Velasco, Christy, & Bihasa, 2021; Musa & Ziatdinov, 2012; Pilapil, 2023). Another important trademark institution was established around this time, specifically Ateneo de Manila University (History of Ateneo de Manila, 2020). With these strides in progress, an adaptable and firm enough educational system to local circumstances was recognized in the Philippines.</p>

						<h2 style="color: white"><br>The Path Moving Forward</h2>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The Catholic Church’s contributions played a central role in Philippine education for almost 300 years as the authority of the inclusion of the natives under government activity was just emerging (Low, Maghanoy, Velasco, Christy, & Bihasa, 2021). As the education system evolved over time, Christianity and religion itself has greatly influenced the Philippines’ culture, traditions, and mindsets — as the population also became larger. Foreign and Christian concepts have since become intertwined with indigenous and colonial influences, shaping what is now the primary Filipino culture. Moreover, it became a lasting legacy of Spanish missionaries who founded the Church’s authority upon their arrival.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Apart from religion and education, the arrival of Western inventions such as the Spanish language, and culture, alongside local language and writing systems were introduced (Low, Maghanoy, Velasco, Christy, & Bihasa, 2021).</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Even at the prospect of reforms in education, there was still an innate desire for freedom under the colonial government, which manifested in a number of ways. At the effort of numerous movements under the illustrados like Jose Rizal and the common folk, the Philippine Revolution eventually became a reality.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The Spaniards left a mark on the nation in its over 300 years of colonization, and the foundation of a formal education was an important development in the country.</p>

						<h2 style="color: white"><br>Rizal’s Involvement</h2>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The educational system of the Philippines under the Spaniards was multifaceted, with influences stemming from native participation and the duty of Spanish social power. Education during this time was heavily pastoral, largely controlled by various religious orders which had a vested interest in maintaining influence over the artistic and intellectual development of the Philippines. Primary education was made obligatory, but it largely served the interests of the Spanish social government to foster obedience and religious devotion rather than critical thinking or creative expression.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Two vital factors played a significant part in shaping the educational geography during this time, which would have greatly influenced Dr. Jose Rizal (Sicat, 2019).</p>

						<ol style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 12%;">
							<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Verbal walls</span> - education was conducted primarily in Spanish, a language accessible only to the mestizos and the rich classes in society. Moreover, the overall system of learning at the time generally catered to the upper elite and those considered relevant enough by the society. This created a significant hedge for the knowledge of Filipinos, effectively banning them from advanced literacy and the openings that came with it. Rizal came from a privileged background, which allowed him to study in the stylish seminaries of his time, locally and abroad. It could be argued that advantage and form of privilege also allowed him to witness the dynamics present inside and outside academic environments. This important factor would allow him to elaborate on the topic in his literary works and portray these circumstances as needed.</li>
							<br>
							<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Limited curriculum, with a focus on religion</span> - the class was generally centered on Christian doctrine and morals, with a strong emphasis on memorization and blind obedience. The authority of the friars and the power they possessed could have contributed to the different portrayals in his novels. Rizal, who was known for his progressive ideas and reformist station, endured these various experiences first-hand.</li>
						</ol>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">As both a pupil and as a full-grown adult, he was acutely apprehensive and aware of the failures of the education system and the government at large. He believed that genuine development and liberation could be aided through education- but the system itself needed to be unbiased, free from religious and social fetters, and one that fostered critical thinking and scientific inquiry (Obias, 2020). 
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">He brought to life his sentiments through his novel, "Noli Me Tángere," which includes critical analyses towards the educational system, using various scenes to punctuate its failings towards the natives and marginalized communities.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">However, Rizal's revolutionary ideas about education inevitably posed trouble to social governance, as education was seen as a means to awaken public knowledge and participation. His education, both in the Philippines and abroad, became the gauntlet for his reformist ideas that would fuel the Propaganda Movement, seeking to make a more indifferent Filipino society. Rizal's educational gests and the broader environment of the latter half of the Philippine education system emphasized the transformative eventuality of education as a tool for social and political change (Ocampo, 2011).</p>
