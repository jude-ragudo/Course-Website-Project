								<h1 class="page-title" style="margin-top: 4%;">The State of Academia in Rizal’s Novels</h1>	
								<h3 style="color: white">Perspective on Rizal’s Ideas and Perspectives Concerning the Education System</h3>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%; margin-top: 5%;">Like many other Filipinos, Jose Rizal was exposed to the realities of his time period, and the matter of education was no exception. It is no secret that the National hero had a very illustrious school life. He was famously known to have attended Ateneo, University of Santo Tomas, and the University of Madrid, and generally embodied the standards of an intellectual student and individual (Zaide, 2018a; Zaide, 2018c; Zaide, 2018d).</p>
					
								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Rizal’s advocacy in education was also apparent, as his family members fostered the idea of it as a tool — alongside religion — to spearhead the development of a nation and its people (Zaide, 2018b).</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Thus, he was not shy delving into a mixture of these realities and personal inputs in his most famous works, Noli Me Tángere and El Filibusterismo.</p>

								<h2 style="color: white"><br>Noli Me Tángere</h2>
								
								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The first novel briefly touched on the topic, more so from the perspectives of the adults or characters that are beyond the age of acquiring a standard form of education. This is read through individuals like Ibarra, Pilosopong Tasio, the schoolmaster, Father Damaso, and any person that witnessed or contributed to the construction of the school could be somewhat aware of the current education system.</p>
					
								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">In Chapter 19 - Adventures of a Schoolmaster, Rizal explores these realities through the conversation of Ibarra with the schoolmaster (Rizal, 1961/2009a). In this scene, four points are raised: (1) the socio-economic background as an important factor in receiving an education, (2) the imposing threat and authority of the Spaniards, (3) the use of corporal punishment to discipline and humiliate students, and (4) the contradicting learning techniques that manipulates the use of Spanish and Tagalog against the student’s benefit.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">It is clear that Rizal wanted to mention the difficulties of the natives that are either students or faculty at academia. At the hands of the colonial government — or rather whatever form of administration — a faulty education system is a burdensome process to undergo through considering that wide-spread reform is mostly dependent on good and rightful governance.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">It is only through Ibarra’s proposal — someone influential, who possesses connections and wealth — that a solution is created in the form of the construction of a school. However, his idea is received with skepticism not only because of its execution but his unwavering belief that the government would approve and actively support his idea. In a fierce debate with Pilosopo Tasio in Chapter 26, the two men embody different stances on the matter (Rizal, 1961/2009b).</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">For Ibarra, he takes a more idealist approach. He essentially believes that while the colonial government has its weaknesses, it still has the best interests of the Philippines and its functions. On the other hand, Pilosopo Tasio possesses a more pessimistic demeanor on the matter, convinced that a mixture of human nature and the self-regard of the colonial government (and in that regard, Spain) emphasizes the subservient system and mentality unto the natives. The chapter ends with Ibarra ultimately pursuing his plans while Pilosopo Tasio is still skeptical towards its completion (Rizal, 1961/2009b).</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The fate of the school’s construction was ultimately predicted by Pilosopo Tasio on Chapter 33 - The Derrick, as it was destroyed on the day of its opening (Rizal, 1961/2009c).</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">When comparing Rizal and Ibarra, some similarities can be drawn in their hopefulness towards the Spanish government and the possibility of reforms. However, these specific aspirations were never fulfilled and the cusp of a permanent change — a revolution — was more visible with each passing development.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">In spite of its relatively short mentions, the state of the education system and its impact towards the Philippines is clear in the novel. As much as it is another form of control and influence headed by the Spanish government through its dominance of friars, it is also a matter of privilege not many can continuously pursue relative to other external factors they face. This is an undeniable reality in the current time as it was back then.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Moreover, Rizal ultimately choosing to write the failure of the school’s opening was a selective decision — as his approach could be interpreted in a number of ways.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">For one, it allows the matter of class and influence to be brought up in an unfair system just like one under the colonial government. How much impact could you create when you are at the mercy of the authorities and their self-interest? How long can these solutions be corrupted or sabotaged beyond your control? Whatever your current status is, how are you supposed to prepare your children in braving through these outcomes? These are most likely the questions Rizal wanted the readers to ponder on.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Additionally, the focus on the adults’ perspective was also an important decision. It ultimately reveals the various backgrounds that either underwent through the same education system, those who didn't, or those who have authority over it. Their respective input and reaction towards the school’s construction is also pertinent, as it reveals a culmination of experience and opinion at the hands of the colonial government. It also reflects that individuals like Ibarra or Pilosopo Tasio could only do so much from an outsider’s perspective. They don't get to witness or experience first-hand the more recent developments of the education system, and its accompanying strengths and weaknesses.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">As Rizal’s first novel in his duology, it provides another instance of the friars’ influence alongside the colonial government seeping into all aspects of living in the Philippines. He encourages the notion that individuals and natives like him — adults or non-students — should just be as concerned of the impact current educational administrations have on future generations.</p>

								<h2 style="color: white"><br>El Filibusterismo (The Sequel)</h2>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">In the absence of characters or scenes that dedicate itself to exploring a first-hand account of the education system, the sequel places the theme centerfold. Returning characters like Basilio evolve and his participation in the education system and the extension of school life is apparent. On the other hand, new characters like Isagani, Father Fernandez, Placido Penitente, Juanito Pelaez, Father Millon, Makaraig and the like explore the nuances of the system.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Chapters 6, 12, 13, and 19 provide concrete examples of the prevailing issues present in the education system — namely, the factor of socio-economic class towards faculty and student perception, the humiliation and humor at the expense of the targeted students, and the friars as a driving force for the system to be implemented in the way it was intended (Rizal, 1965/2010a; Rizal, 1965/2010b; Rizal, 1965/2010c; Rizal, 1965/2010e).</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">It is crucial that the culmination of these segments are elaborated upon to showcase the struggles that can actually happen, as well as to rouse emotion and sentiments from the audience. This is also to not reduce these issues as mere statistics or conditions as inevitabilities of society. Similarly, it helps subconsciously ask the readers what they would do in their position. Or, it even encourages them to recall back their own experiences in academia and reflect if it has really changed at all. This is especially in regards to the different treatment characters like Basilio and Placido Penitente experience.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">While these portrayals could be argued as exaggerated or personal anecdotes from Rizal’s life, it still reflects the reality at the time and the various difficulties students have to come to terms with in order to officially acquire an education.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Even in outside premises, the students are not entirely safe from suspicion and subjugation either. For one, casual gatherings or discussions — borderline discourses — about the possibility of reforms in the education system are seen as hostile engagements to participate in as evident by Chapters 14, 25, 26, 27, 28, 32, and 33 (Rizal, 1965/2010d; Rizal, 1965/2010f; Rizal, 1965/2010g; Rizal, 1965/2010h; Rizal, 1965/2010i; Rizal, 1965/2010j; Rizal, 1965/2010k). The root of the majority of problems — the supposed good of the government, the authority of the friars, the manipulative role of religion, the suppression of Filipino cultural and nationalistic endeavors, the firm hand of the university in the student affairs, the power at the hands of the elites — is ultimately reflected as the effects of the Spanish colonization.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">It can be interpreted that the reasons for the students’ implication and punishment (in the aforementioned chapters) is not only for the recognition of these conditions — but also the act of actively voicing them out in a large gathering. Thus, it can be equated as a gesture of criticism and even rebellion. Not only does this event spark chaos amongst the student population, but it also reveals that there is no singular or correct way to approach this. Their eventual fates and accompanying punishments are built on a system against them. Moreover, leaving one's post — essentially running away — is the wisest and safest option in spite of the effort one experienced.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">In this regard, one’s fate is a matter of luck which proves disadvantageous to individuals like Basilio who manages to get imprisoned and Isagani — whose relationship with Paulita is discontinued as a result of the events (Rizal, 1965/2010j; Rizal, 1965/2010k).</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Being a student in the Spanish colonial times is a risk especially if one is not born into natural wealth and advantages. Rizal deciding to embody this rhetoric through Basilio is an important choice as it emphasizes the factors of luck and background to one’s treatment. The essence of possessing good or brave moral character is not enough for one to be exempted from the eyes of the authority. One should always be aware of the inner workings of the education system to survive it and therefore the society they will enter in as adults.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">However, the discourses in Chapter 14 - A Students’ Hand also reveals another truth or stance expertly crafted by Rizal — in that one should have an opinion in the events happening in one’s environment (Rizal, 1965/2010d). As Filipinos, one should always have a firm and clear stance on past and current matters to not lose sight and direction of the reality and systems that are experienced. </p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">It was intentional that Rizal wanted to emphasize the role of the youth in his sequel novel. He wanted to emphasize them as products of their society, and thus vulnerable from the various circumstances they encounter. The conspiracy and eventual consequences that resulted from the spread posters is also a reminder that no matter one’s position or state in society, they are exposed to the dangers of the colonial government in one way or another. As a result, they must face the reality of their conditions and deal with it through the actions they deem acceptable.</p>

								<h2 style="color: white"><br>The Takeaways of the Portrayal of Education in Rizal’s Novels</h2>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Rizal, as a genius writer and intellectual on many different matters, was not shy to discuss the educational system in “Noli me Tángere” and “El Filibusterismo”. The illustration of perspectives by both adults and students were wise narrative choices to make as to showcase the reactions and conditions society had to face.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">From the perspective of the students, some are lucky enough to have an education, while others barely manage because of discrimination. The reality is that some cannot even afford to enroll at all given socio-economic and racial background.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">For those who can go to school, the academic environment can be a challenging matter at the involvement of the friars, the poor teaching techniques, and the possible danger they could put themselves in by acting against authority. While it is a reflection and extension of the colonial government, it is still a challenging condition to face to its completion. It is a difficult venture since receiving an education is an unavoidable key for opportunities and success — especially if it can be one of the only routes one can take to their desired life.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Pursuing the morally right, correct, or brave action as a student is a dangerous decision that can result in the loss of privileges and connection and imprisonment at worse. Staying silent and essentially complicit to the system is the only solution advisable. And yet, Rizal reminds the importance of one possessing a stance and opinion to combat blind ignorance and faith to the education system and to the governance as a whole.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">On the other hand, adults or (technically) outsiders/non-students in this regard, either have to come up with ways to establish schools themselves, or have to subscribe to the reality that the education system is biased, and will remain unchanged for the good of the Filipino people. No matter what position one is during the times of the colonial period, one will inevitably be subjected to the expectations and harsh realities of the education system. Rizal also emphasized that individual contributions, especially those at a higher position in life is not enough, and the collective efforts of the people should be established.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">However, these actions could only be done so much under a colonial government or an ineffective one at that. To allow permanent and effective change to happen for the benefit of students, faculty, and the general population of a nation — reforms and a new form of government should be implemented.</p>
