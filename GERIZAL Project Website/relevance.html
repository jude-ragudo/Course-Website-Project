						<h1 class="page-title" style="margin-top: 4%;">Rizal in Current Times</h1>	
						<h3 style="color: white">Relevance of Rizal’s Idea in Contemporary Context</h3>

						<h2 style="color: white"><br>21st Century Philippines and the Current Education System</h2>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">In the 21st century, the enduring impact of Jose Rizal continues to serve as a reminder concerning educational equity. His strong confidence in the power of education, as well as his literary works and life, have greatly influenced Filipino identity - which has subsequently impacted the nation's approaches to both education and modern issues.</p>
			
						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Rizal's address for universal education in his novels aligns closely with the principles enshrined in the Philippine Constitution, which acknowledges education as a fundamental right available to all Filipinos (Official Gazette, 1987) unlike during his time when education was more of a privilege than a right (Durban & Catalan, 2012). According to Rizal's educational theory, it is critical to provide pupils with the right motivation since doing so will enable them to access the powerful social forces that support academic success. He pushed for establishing in young people a desire to increase their intelligence and learn new things, which would enable them to pursue learning passionately for the rest of their lives (Philosophies in Life, 2004). Looking through this perspective, education isn't just about gaining knowledge. It's also about paving the way for our society to move forward and strengthening a shared sense of identity and unity as a nation.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Although the Philippine Constitution places a high value on education, the country currently has several challenges in offering quality education. One is the lack of educational resources, especially for public schools. A lot of schools have trouble getting the most recent textbooks, supplemental materials, and other supplies needed for efficient teaching and learning. In addition to limiting the accessibility of education, this shortfall restricts students' access to a wide range of educational possibilities.</p>

						
						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Another critical issue is the need for more school infrastructure, including classrooms and buildings. Public schools usually have overcrowded classrooms, damaged facilities, and insufficient important amenities which are opposite qualities of a conducive learning environment. Additionally, the lack of technology restricts students from having access to hands-on learning opportunities (Coloquit, 2020).</p>
			
						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The Philippines' low academic success and weak foundation may be caused by flaws in the education system, which is reflected in the nation's standing in foreign evaluations, according to the Index of Global Competitiveness. The World Economic Forum stated in 2017–2018 that, of 137 nations, the Philippines has placed “76th in mathematics, 74th for quality education, 66th for primary education, and Science”  (Coloquit, 2020) (p. 98). According to another 2018 survey, out of 79 countries, a selected number of 15-year-old Filipino children scored the lowest on reading comprehension. They came in 78th place in math and science as well. This study suggests that the majority of individuals who took the test attended public schools, which is an important finding as it implies that many Filipinos can’t read or perform basic skills such as Math (Childhope, 2021). Thus, the country is falling behind other nations when it comes to overall educational quality.
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The current state of the Philippine education system creates an uneven playing field for students. The issues discussed such as lack of resources, infrastructure, and overburdened teachers, are reflected in the country's low rankings on international assessments. Although private schools might possess more resources to offer a more comprehensive education, children in public schools are left with a lesser foundation, which might limit their academic success and potentially cause obstacles to achieving a brighter future. This situation raises concerns about fairness in the system, as public school students, though having no control beyond their situation, may not be getting the same opportunities to succeed as their private school counterparts</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Despite some of the Philippine government's ongoing efforts, the education system faces a complicated chain of problems.  There is still a socioeconomic disparity because well-off individuals tend to have better educational opportunities.  Moreover, learning results are challenged by systemic problems including limited resources and traditional methods of learning, particularly in public schools. These disparities have been made worse by the pandemic, emphasizing the necessity of thorough changes.  Government, educators, and society at large must work together to guarantee that every Filipino has access to high-quality education.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The ongoing gap between government efforts and the real results in the educational system is one notable instance. Even with ongoing efforts to improve educational quality, the system's underlying problems are oftentimes not sufficiently addressed by these programs. This gap emphasizes how important it is for policy objectives and actual conditions to be more in line to bring about significant change.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The social divide perfectly mirrors the status of education in the Philippines. Wealthy urban areas have modern facilities and highly skilled educators, replicating the privilege of natives and other groups during Rizal's time. Underdeveloped rural communities, on the other hand, struggle with a lack of resources and infrastructure, mirroring the underdevelopment of the education system then. This persistent socioeconomic gap in access to quality education fuels social tensions, restricts opportunities for success, and hinders Filipinos' ability to reach their full potential.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Jose Rizal's lasting impact emphasizes how crucial educational equity is to the formation of the Filipino identity and the advancement of the country. </p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Although the Philippine Constitution declares education a fundamental right, the country still struggles with issues including poor infrastructure, low academic achievement, and insufficient resources. These problems worsen socioeconomic inequality by maintaining the gap between private and public schooling. The education system finds it difficult to close the gap between policy objectives and actual results, even with continuous efforts by the government. The Philippines' existing educational system is a reflection of the country's ongoing social gap, which limits people's ability to succeed.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Furthermore, speaking out against the government was very dangerous during the Spanish colonial era. People who dared to express disapproval faced harsh penalties, such as imprisonment or even death. Every aspect of life, including education, were tightly regulated by the Spanish government. It was risky for those like Rizal to speak out against injustice or urge for change in this repressive atmosphere.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">The case of the Office for Student Affairs (OSA) directing TomasinoWeb to remove a picture showing College of Information and Computing Sciences (CICS) students entering a University-owned convenience shop while wearing their "Type B" uniforms shows this kind of oppression. The image was taken down due to being a source of public ridicule, which illustrates an environment in which even harmless posts are being suppressed (Cardinez, 2024). An incident that highlights the ongoing suppression of expression and the chilling effect it has on freedom of speech, similar to the oppressive atmosphere during the Spanish colonial era.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Even though the Philippines attained independence in the present, traces of the repressive government still exist. This shows an atmosphere in which dissent might not be accepted, reflecting the constant fight for advancement and the need for perseverance in the face of difficulty, which symbolizes Rizal's struggles.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 7%;">Moreover, his ideology and philosophy of the importance of education is still a reality that is not yet fully utilized or implemented in the current society. At the cost of the issues that were once experienced in the colonial period, new challenges emerge to test the spirit, will, and capabilities of the Filipino people.</p>
